React JS Snapshot Master is a GitHub repository that contains a single-page web application built using ReactJS. The application allows users to search for images based on a search term and displays a gallery of images that match the search query. The images are sourced from the Unsplash API, which is integrated with the application.

The application features a responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices. The user interface is minimalistic, with a search bar at the top of the page and a grid of images below. The images are displayed in a modal when clicked, which also allows users to download the image or view it on the Unsplash website.

The codebase is organized into separate components, which are reusable and easy to understand. The project utilizes modern front-end development tools such as Webpack, Babel, and ESLint, and also includes testing with Jest and Enzyme.
